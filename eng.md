**A note from the editors:** Rachel Andrew knows a thing or two about launching
products. Read more of her insights in her March 2014 cover story for

Last time, [I encouraged you to think about creating side projects][2] as a way
to diversify your income. Yet with a busy job or freelance business, a family, 
friends, and other activities, it can seem incredibly hard to make time for 
these additional projects. This time I’m going to share some tactics for finding
time to dedicate to additional projects, and the motivation to actually work on 
them.

## Defining your goals<aside class="content-minutiae"></aside>

There is power in setting a goal, writing it down, and putting a date on it. We
can all spend a lot of time musing over that book we would like to write or that
product we would like to build. Until we actually draw a line in the sand and 
commit to launching it, it will likely remain as a thing we pick away at when we
“have the time.
”

Choose your goal, define exactly what it is you are going to create, then
decide on your launch date.

## Planning the steps to reach that goal on that date

Once you have a goal with a date, you can start to plan your time working back
from that end date to today. If your goal is quite chunky and your end date some
months in the future, break down the tasks into monthly phases of work. Check 
out Brian Casel’s concept of the[Cascading To Do List][3] for a description of
how to break down a large goal into smaller sections.

This is where you need to be realistic. You are going to have limited hours to
work on a side project. I’ll get to some of the ways you can maximize the time 
you have available, but first, as you make your plan, ensure you are committing 
yourself to something that is actually possible. Launching in a reasonable 
timeframe is likely to mean working hard, but you still need to sleep and eat. A
surefire way to lose motivation on a project is to feel that you are falling 
behind on your expected progress. Don’t set yourself up to fail with unrealistic
timeframes.

If, on breaking down the tasks needed to meet your goal, you realize that you
don’t have enough time to do everything and meet that goal date, you have a 
choice. Can you remove some elements of the project, putting them into a post-
launch phase? Or do you need to allow more time to complete the project, moving 
your completion date?

I would always favor the first approach where possible. Be as ruthless as you
can in cutting any features from your product that can wait until a phase two. I
’ve written in more detail on the importance of starting small and developing 
your product based on user feedback over on[Smashing Magazine][4]. That method
won’t necessarily work for all products; however, remember that you can also 
simplify the other tasks you need to get to launch—for example, using a service 
that delivers your software (such as[Gumroad][5]) rather than building your own
payment and delivery solution.

## Finding the time<figure class="quote">

We find the time for those things we place importance on. “Finding the time
” often relies upon having a goal that is meaningful and important to you; a 
goal that is valuable enough to make a priority. If you consistently don’t have 
time to make progress on your project, take a reality check: is this something 
you really want to achieve? If you feel it really is a priority for you, move 
forward by fitting it in with the priorities you share with the people in your 
life.

### Explain your workload to family and friends

The additional work required to launch a side project can be hard to understand
if your family and friends aren’t in the same business as you. They may resent 
the extra work you are doing, or feel you are using it as an excuse to get out 
of social engagements or spending time with them.

Having a realistic end date and schedule can really help here. Share your goal
with friends and family, explain the launch date and show that the project isn’t
designed to endlessly burn up all your free time. Having your friends and family
on board will help you to assign time to your project and may even help you gain
a sense of accountability to use your time as you told them you would. You will 
want to be able to let people know your progress toward your launch date.

### Schedule in the time each week

I believe it is very important that our own projects become 
[first class citizens][6] alongside the other work that we do. If you are a
freelancer working for clients, your own product should be given the same 
attention you give a client project. Even if it can only be assigned half a day 
a week, or time that would normally be your free time, ensuring it is given the 
same priority means it will not be pushed out.

As much as is possible for you, set aside time each week to work on the project
. A regular slot works very well if you are able to schedule that. Plan in 
advance the tasks you will tackle during this time in order to make best use of 
it.

### Use down time

Several years ago I earned a degree with the Open University in the United
Kingdom, via distance learning. I did all of the reading for my courses while 
waiting outside my daughter’s ballet classes. You can make great use of downtime
as long as you prepare for it. A good to do list of tasks is the best way to 
ensure you are prepared to make best use of time that appears in your schedule. 
If you are working on the side project alongside client work and you suddenly 
find yourself with a spare morning due to a canceled meeting, you can jump on 
the next available task on your list. Some tasks may be well suited to working 
on while traveling. When I have travel planned, I make sure I have any documents
I need saved offline, and any reading sent to my Kindle so I can make best use 
of the disconnected time in the airplane.

### Outsource to create time

If you can afford to, outsourcing some tasks can help to move your project
forward or free up time to work on it. You don’t even need to outsource the 
actual work of the project. If you currently spend every Saturday morning doing 
housework, could you get a cleaner? Have you considered using a service such as
[FancyHands][7] to do time-intensive but easy tasks such as getting quotes for
services? Make sure that you don’t get involved with busywork, making yourself 
feel as if you are moving forward but instead just filling your time with tasks.

### Optimize your working environment

By their very nature, side projects are often worked on in short periods of
time: a few hours on a Saturday morning, an hour or so each evening. You need to
make sure that when you sit down to work, your tools are all there and ready and
you don’t burn through the time just setting up your IDE, or downloading some 
software. Spend some time at the start setting up a great workflow for the 
project, sign up for any API access you need, install any software. Make sure 
that those short bursts of activity on the project can be used to drive it 
forward.

### Avoid spending too much time creating a productivity system

The tools you use and the systems you follow are likely to be very personal to
you. I follow a fairly standard Getting Things Done (GTD) approach, and use 
OmniFocus. I do think that writing goals and tasks down in some form is 
important; how you do that is up to you. You might like to create your schedule 
and daily task lists on paper, or just in a text editor. It does not matter.

### Say no to things that do not move you toward your goal

In order to meet your goal it is likely that you will have to pass up some
other opportunities. Learn to say no to things that will not help your progress.
Will attending that event, making that business trip, or reading that book get 
you closer to where you need to be?

I find it’s often easier to say no to unrelated things than things that might
be useful. When working toward a goal, I will be happy to say no to a social 
engagement; a conference related to my target audience, however, sounds like it 
might be a good thing to attend. The question I ask myself then is what will 
attending that conference do to my end date—is it worth delaying my launch date?

### Don’t be distracted by post-launch tasks

Something I see happen a lot is that, instead of focusing on the steps to
launch a product, people start researching and reading around things that only 
matter after launch. A very common theme is to spend a lot of time worrying 
about analytics. Leave those things until after you have launched. If you worry 
that you will forget a great idea, then start making a list of things to 
investigate later. You can add items to that list and revisit it post launch to 
plan your next phase.

## Realistic schedules and good planning are the silver bullet

When people ask me how I get so much stuff done, I think they assume I have
some kind of magic trick up my sleeve to share. However the only real answer is 
that I do the work. That said, whenever I start to feel as if work is taking 
over all of my time or end dates are drifting, poor time management is usually 
to blame.

When I am working to focused goals, on a well planned schedule, I find that
there is usually time to get everything done. I’m also happy to do other things,
as I know that the right amount of progress is being made towards my goal. As 
Getting Things Done guru David Allen[says][8],<figure class="quote">

Unless you have a clear schedule taking you from today to launch, you will
either drift along and never launch or constantly worry and feel bad about any 
time you spend not working on your product. Define your goal, and create a plan 
to get from here to there today.**Then roll up your sleeves and work.**
